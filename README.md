##Inspiration
The Langara 2024 hackathon theme was 'nothing'. When it was announced, we saw 'nothing' as a problem that lots of people encounter. No matter in what situation they are, sometimes we just have 'nothing' to do. Due to that, we decided to built "Today", which offers a solution for nothing.

##What it does
Today is a web-based app that is focused on creating a personalized plan generator for you. You can choose how you feel, the time you have, and pick an interest. From there, "Today" will generate a plan for you based on all the things you choose. 

##How we built it
Focusing on the front-end part of things, we mainly developed 'Today' with react.js as the main component, css for basic styling, and we use static data (for easy learning and deliverance).

##Challenges we ran into
Considering this is our very first hackathon for our whole team, time was something that we're all worried of. In the first 24 hours, we have to learn so much more new things, fetching data, debugging codes for hours, and how to collaborate and work effectively.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Although we face challenges throughout our working-time and making adjustments here and there, but we're proud to say that we complete the project just in time. And we're also extremelyq proud of ourselves that we can push through the whole hackathon and not giving up. 

##What we learned
Other then the technical part of things, we mostly learned how to communicate, work together, and breaking boundaries on things that we thought were impossible at the very beginning. We also realized that nothing is impossible when we work hard. 

##What's next for Today
We built "Today" mainly focusing on the basic features only due to time restrictions. However, we believe that "Today" can be so much more! We could implement more databases, adding more features such as user having an account to create history on plans they generated, even more we could implement AI to help generate more data. Basically, the future is "Today".
